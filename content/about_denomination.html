<p>Community of Christ was born in New York in the 19th century, has been headquartered in Missouri since the 20th century, and now in the 21st century has 250,000 members in over 60 nations. We cherish our history and traditions, but we are also listening for God's spirit to lead us in new directions in an increasingly international and interconnected world.</p>
