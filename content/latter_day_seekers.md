Like all of Community of Christ, the Forest Hills congregation is a place where people with a background in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other Restoration traditions can continue their discipleship in a way that connects with their religious heritage but may be meaningful and affirming in new ways. We would be happy to walk with you on your faith journey for one day, a few months, or however long you would like. We're not the kind of church who will come and knock on your door—but **our** doors are always wide open for you to enter.

If you want to learn more about what Community of Christ offers for those from a Latter-day Saint background, you can visit this [website](http://www.latter-dayseekers.org/), join this [private Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/latterdayseekers), or read over this [written introduction](/continuing-your-discipleship.pdf). Of course, you are always welcome to join us on Sundays in person or on Zoom—or to [directly contact](mailto:spencer.greenhalgh@posteo.net) with a member of our congregation who was once a Latter-day Seeker. Then again, faith transition is difficult, and you might not be ready to join us in person yet. In that case, [Forward with Community](http://www.forwardwithcommunity.org/) is a once-a-month online worship service for Latter-day Seekers, and the [Toronto Centre Place congregation](https://www.centreplace.ca/) (and its weekly streamed, international services) is another place where many Latter-day Seekers have found a home.
