In 1998, a Scripture Garden was built on the Forest Hills church property. The Garden contains thousands of plants and flowers, a large pergola, an arch area, benches and walkways, and numerous bronze plaques with Scriptures on them mounted on large boulders. In addition, there are a number of historic trees from all over the world on the property. The Garden is lit at night until after midnight, is handicap accessible and is open to the public for meditation, enjoyment of nature, and events like weddings. If you would like to reserve the garden for a special occasion or event, you can contact us through the form on [this page](/contact_us/).

The Garden is just one of many ways that we try to be involved with local and other communities. The City of Forest Hills uses the church building for city meetings, voting, blood drives, and community gatherings. Members of our congregation participate in homeless outreach with [Love Transformation Project](https://lovetransformationproject.org/), in providing resources to those in crisis with [Jeffersontown Area Ministries](https://www.facebook.com/JeffersontownAreaMinistries), and in supporting families of sick children through [Ronald McDonald House Charities of Kentuckiana](https://rmhc-kentuckiana.org/). Every Sunday, we collect donations for [Outreach International](https://outreach-international.org/), a worldwide nonprofit affiliated with Community of Christ and dedicated to empowering communities and addressing poverty-related issues.
