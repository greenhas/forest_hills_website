In 1971, several members of Community of Christ bought what remained of the original farm that the present City of Forest Hills was built on. The purchased property had the original two story farm house with an old tree-lined lane leading up to it. In 1975, the Forest Hills congregation was officially formed; members met in the original farmhouse. In 1983, members began building the church building that exists today, and the older buildings were then torn down. The congregation did lots of construction on the building, and even the children helped shingle the roof! The building was consecrated May 14, 1989. 

Our congregation today includes some who helped build our building more than 30 years ago but also many who have joined us since then. Our congregation is made up of Louisville natives and those who joined us after moving from Wisconsin, Ohio, and many other places; thanks to the miracle of Zoom, our building in Forest Hills sees regular attendance from members and friends of our congregation as "close" as Lexington and as far as Florida. Everyone—including ordained lay ministers and volunteer disciples—pitches in to keep the congregation running. Our current pastor is Jay Rogers, and he can be contacted through the form on [this page](/contact_us/).
